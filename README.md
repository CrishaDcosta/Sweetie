This is a recipe of Easter egg. The name egg does not actually refer to an egg. It's just given for an instance. From a Christian perspective, Easter eggs are said to represent Jesus' emergence from the tomb and resurrection.  It may also be no surprise they are sometimes referred to as “resurrection eggs.”
